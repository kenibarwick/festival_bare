<p>Your children are your responsibility, please supervise them appropriately, and have fun together!</p>
<p>Festival Hosts in yellow tabards are here for your comfort and safety – grab one if you need any help or have any questions.
<p>The First Aid & Lost Children tent and Security can be found by the main gate. Both are open 24 hours.
<p>Unsupervised children will not be allowed to leave the main festival site to access the woods, shower block or camper van fields  without a <i>roaming child</i> wristband (available from Front of House).
<p>Camp carefully – leave plenty of room between tents and please, only one gazebo per encampment.</p>
<p>Fire points are shown on the site map.  No fires are allowed in the camp site.
<p>Use camping stoves outside to guard against fire and carbon-monoxide poisoning.
<p>Leave the music to us – no sound systems in the camp sites, please.
<p>Keep hands clean – wild animals don’t clean up after themselves.  
<p>Hot water for hand washing can be found in the permanent toilet blocks.
<p>Keep the festival tidy – use the litter and recycling bins provided and keep cigarette butts off the floor.
