	<h2>Chilled in a Field Festival</h2>
	Chilled in a field is a feel-good family friendly festival full of fun. Relax, unwind and make new and lasting friendships with a backdrop of creative and sociable activities, great music and a range of freshly prepared food. We’re a social gathering, where adults and children can make new friends, discover new experiences and enjoy nature as well as having a whole lot of silly fun. It’s a festival weekend jam-packed full of free activities for all the family. And when the children have been put to bed there’s plenty to keep grown-ups amused.

	<h2>App</h2>
	The Chilled in a Field app was made by the @themobileguy, Tom Booth and Paul Mayes. It's written using Cordova and the Ionic framework.
